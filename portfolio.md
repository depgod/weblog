### Portfolio

I love linux, discovered it in my under graduation days while studying about plants and learning about life and friends. I was mistaken right after my schooling that I'wd do just fine in biology and was just not listening to my heart. But things actually started to make sense as I started a local in-college business to fix phones of my friends, ended up learning a lot about gnu/linux and compiling software and understanding the value of OSS midway.

Currently prepping for a linux certification to move in to the IT field, gotta follow the heart.  
RHCSA is it for now but as I plan to progress I'll start to deploy self-hosted free to use services for the commons, like nextcloud / bitwarden / zerobin etc.


Will try my best to keep this place as updated as possible and will try to provide awesome self-hosted services for free for the commons.

Thank You.
