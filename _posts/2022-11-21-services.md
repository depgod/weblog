# Services

I recently managed to setup a tiny homelab composed off machines I gathered from friends and families which they had no use of I
set it up basically from old intel celeron and a few old intel 6th gen laptops with dead batteries for which I had to plug them 
in direct AC supply. Major part of the setup was wiring, switches and a router with a tiny reliable power backup.

For most of the servers I use ![Ubuntu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-E95420?style=for-the-badge&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white)
 ubuntu but 1-2 has ![Arch](https://img.shields.io/badge/Arch%20Linux-1793D1?logo=arch-linux&logoColor=fff&style=for-the-badge)
 arch linux and the rest are on proxmox.

As a tril period I have spun up a few containers which are mentioned below to check out if it is feasible enough to keep them running
for free, No sign ups now as they are just for trial.
